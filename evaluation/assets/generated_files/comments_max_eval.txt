==== measurement points as additional variable =====

Single sensor -> with 0, 0, inf -> measures exactly true position
Single sensor -> vary temporal resolution -> skips measurements
Single sensor -> vary spatial resolution -> introduces error to measurements
Single sensor -> vary spatial reach -> skips measurements

Combination of sensors (Number, Positioning & reach/overlap)
